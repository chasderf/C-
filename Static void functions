Mymethod( ) is the name of the method

Static means that the method belongs to the program class and not an object of the program class.
You will learn more about objects and how to access methods through objects later in this tutorial

Void means that this class doesnâ€™t return a value.

So static means that the function is not an object and it is now part of a program class

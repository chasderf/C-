Methods are used to perform certain actions, and they are also known as functions
You can pass data, known as parameters into a method
A method is a block of code which only runs when it is called.
Why use methods? To reuse code: define the code once, and use it many times

Class program
{
Static void MyMethod ( )
{
// code to be executed
}
}

So the algorthm does a task. And methods, procedures and functions complete tasks. Void
functions don’t return a value.

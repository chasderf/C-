We can add two strings together by using the
• “+” symbol or by
• “String name = string.Concat(firstName, LastName);”
Console.writeLine(name)
So whenever we want to mix two different strings together then we will have to string.concat
String interpoloation:: it substitutes variables within a command line
String first name
..

String name = $”My full name is: {FirstName} {LastName}”;
Console.WriteLine(name);
